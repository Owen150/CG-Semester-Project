# Brutal Doom
A first-person Shooter game using WebGL, Pycharm, and three.js

# Tools and Technologies
WebGL, Pycharm, and three.js

# Milestones
1. Setting Up the Environment
HTML Canvas: Create an HTML canvas element to serve as the rendering area for your WebGL content.
Initialize WebGL Context: Use JavaScript to obtain the WebGL context and set up the necessary configurations.
2. Graphics and Rendering
Shaders: Write vertex and fragment shaders to handle rendering. Shaders are programs that run on the GPU and are responsible for rendering objects.
Loading Models and Textures: Import 3D models and textures into your game. You can use formats like OBJ, glTF, or others that are supported by WebGL.
Rendering Pipeline: Implement a rendering pipeline that includes aspects like lighting, shadows, textures, and effects.
3. Implementing Game Logic
Player Movement: Define controls for the player's movement, including walking, jumping, and crouching.
Camera Controls: Set up the first-person perspective by controlling the camera movement and orientation.
4. Interactivity and Gameplay
Shooting Mechanics: Implement shooting mechanics, including aiming, firing, and handling projectiles.
Scoring and Health: Keep track of the player's health, score, and any other relevant game statistics.
5. User Interface.
Menus and UI Elements: Create menus for starting the game, changing settings, or accessing different game modes.
