# Brutal Doom
Computer Graphics Semester Project
First Person Shooter Game using Unity Game Engine and WebGL

# Overview
The aim of this project is to create a first-person shooter game using WebGL for rendering and interacting with the game at web-level graphics and Python for the backend logic.

# Specifications
The game design will include levels, characters, weapons, and other assets. We will use 3D Modelling software to create and export 3D Models and textures.

# Classic FPS controls: 
Move the mouse to look and turn around and Use AWSD keys to move your character to shoot press the left mouse button.
Shooting Mechanics: Implement shooting mechanics, including aiming, firing, and handling projectiles.
Scoring and Health: Keep track of the player's health, score, and any other relevant game statistics.

# Frontend Development (WebGL)
Set up a WebGL canvas in HTML for rendering the game and use Javascript (Three.js) along with the chosen WebGL framework to handle graphics, user input, and game logic.
Here we will also implement features such as character movement, shooting mechanisms, and rendering of the game world.

#Backend Development (Python)				
We will use Python for server-side logic.
